        <h2>Caring and Harmony-Seeking Nature</h2>

        <p> Feelers prioritize the feelings and well-being of others around them, 
            which is typified by their compassionate and empathic disposition. 
            They are excellent team players that value relationships with others and create a peaceful environment. 
            They also prefer to preserve agreement and make compromises, which demonstrates their caring approach and fosters an atmosphere where people feel understood and supported.
        </p>

        <h2> Resistance to Change and Conflict Avoidance</h2>

        <p> Feelers have a deep dislike of confrontation and a resistance to change. 
            They favor stability over uncertainty and look for situations that provide them a sense of safety and security. 
            This resistance to change might occasionally cause people to be reluctant to push themselves above their comfort zones. 
            On the other hand, their dedication to preserving peace makes relationships and groups more solid and encouraging.
        </p>

        <h2>Steady and Stubborn</h2>

        <p> 
            Feelers are steadfast and unyielding in their approach, offering a dependable and constant presence. 
            They value the maintenance of emotional balance and contribute to a calm environment. 
            Even if they might stay out of trouble, their obstinacy shows that they are devoted to their beliefs and that they are determined to protect the welfare of each member of the group.
